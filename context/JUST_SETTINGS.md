### [Settings](https://just.systems/man/en/settings.html#settings)

Settings control interpretation and execution. Each setting may be specified at most once, anywhere in the `justfile`.

For example:

``set shell := ["zsh", "-cu"]  foo:   # this line will be run as `zsh -cu 'ls **/*.txt'`   ls **/*.txt``

#### [Allow Duplicate Recipes](https://just.systems/man/en/settings.html#allow-duplicate-recipes)

If `allow-duplicate-recipes` is set to `true`, defining multiple recipes with the same name is not an error and the last definition is used. Defaults to `false`.

`set allow-duplicate-recipes  @foo:   echo foo  @foo:   echo bar`

`$ just foo bar`

#### [Allow Duplicate Variables](https://just.systems/man/en/settings.html#allow-duplicate-variables)

If `allow-duplicate-variables` is set to `true`, defining multiple variables with the same name is not an error and the last definition is used. Defaults to `false`.

`set allow-duplicate-variables  a := "foo" a := "bar"  @foo:   echo {{a}}`

`$ just foo bar`

#### [Dotenv Settings](https://just.systems/man/en/settings.html#dotenv-settings)

If any of `dotenv-load`, `dotenv-filename`, `dotenv-override`, `dotenv-path`, or `dotenv-required` are set, `just` will try to load environment variables from a file.

If `dotenv-path` is set, `just` will look for a file at the given path, which may be absolute, or relative to the working directory.

The command-line option `--dotenv-path`, short form `-E`, can be used to set or override `dotenv-path` at runtime.

If `dotenv-filename` is set `just` will look for a file at the given path, relative to the working directory and each of its ancestors.

If `dotenv-filename` is not set, but `dotenv-load` or `dotenv-required` are set, just will look for a file named `.env`, relative to the working directory and each of its ancestors.

`dotenv-filename` and `dotenv-path` are similar, but `dotenv-path` is only checked relative to the working directory, whereas `dotenv-filename` is checked relative to the working directory and each of its ancestors.

It is not an error if an environment file is not found, unless `dotenv-required` is set.

The loaded variables are environment variables, not `just` variables, and so must be accessed using `$VARIABLE_NAME` in recipes and backticks.

If `dotenv-override` is set, variables from the environment file will override existing environment variables.

For example, if your `.env` file contains:

`# a comment, will be ignored DATABASE_ADDRESS=localhost:6379 SERVER_PORT=1337`

And your `justfile` contains:

`set dotenv-load  serve:   @echo "Starting server with database $DATABASE_ADDRESS on port $SERVER_PORT…"   ./server --database $DATABASE_ADDRESS --port $SERVER_PORT`

`just serve` will output:

`$ just serve Starting server with database localhost:6379 on port 1337… ./server --database $DATABASE_ADDRESS --port $SERVER_PORT`

#### [Export](https://just.systems/man/en/settings.html#export)

The `export` setting causes all `just` variables to be exported as environment variables. Defaults to `false`.

`set export  a := "hello"  @foo b:   echo $a   echo $b`

`$ just foo goodbye hello goodbye`

#### [Positional Arguments](https://just.systems/man/en/settings.html#positional-arguments)

If `positional-arguments` is `true`, recipe arguments will be passed as positional arguments to commands. For linewise recipes, argument `$0` will be the name of the recipe.

For example, running this recipe:

`set positional-arguments  @foo bar:   echo $0   echo $1`

Will produce the following output:

`$ just foo hello foo hello`

When using an `sh`\-compatible shell, such as `bash` or `zsh`, `$@` expands to the positional arguments given to the recipe, starting from one. When used within double quotes as `"$@"`, arguments including whitespace will be passed on as if they were double-quoted. That is, `"$@"` is equivalent to `"$1" "$2"`… When there are no positional parameters, `"$@"` and `$@` expand to nothing (i.e., they are removed).

This example recipe will print arguments one by one on separate lines:

`set positional-arguments  @test *args='':   bash -c 'while (( "$#" )); do echo - $1; shift; done' -- "$@"`

Running it with _two_ arguments:

`$ just test foo "bar baz" - foo - bar baz`

Positional arguments may also be turned on on a per-recipe basis with the `[positional-arguments]` attribute1.29.0:

`[positional-arguments] @foo bar:   echo $0   echo $1`

Note that PowerShell does not handle positional arguments in the same way as other shells, so turning on positional arguments will likely break recipes that use PowerShell.

If using PowerShell 7.4 or better, the `-CommandWithArgs` flag will make positional arguments work as expected:

`set shell := ['pwsh.exe', '-CommandWithArgs'] set positional-arguments  print-args a b c:   Write-Output @($args[1..($args.Count - 1)])`

#### [Shell](https://just.systems/man/en/settings.html#shell)

The `shell` setting controls the command used to invoke recipe lines and backticks. Shebang recipes are unaffected. The default shell is `sh -cu`.

``# use python3 to execute recipe lines and backticks set shell := ["python3", "-c"]  # use print to capture result of evaluation foos := `print("foo" * 4)`  foo:   print("Snake snake snake snake.")   print("{{foos}}")``

`just` passes the command to be executed as an argument. Many shells will need an additional flag, often `-c`, to make them evaluate the first argument.

##### [Windows Shell](https://just.systems/man/en/settings.html#windows-shell)

`just` uses `sh` on Windows by default. To use a different shell on Windows, use `windows-shell`:

`set windows-shell := ["powershell.exe", "-NoLogo", "-Command"]  hello:   Write-Host "Hello, world!"`

See [powershell.just](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/examples/powershell.just) for a justfile that uses PowerShell on all platforms.

##### [Windows PowerShell](https://just.systems/man/en/settings.html#windows-powershell)

_`set windows-powershell` uses the legacy `powershell.exe` binary, and is no longer recommended. See the `windows-shell` setting above for a more flexible way to control which shell is used on Windows._

`just` uses `sh` on Windows by default. To use `powershell.exe` instead, set `windows-powershell` to true.

`set windows-powershell := true  hello:   Write-Host "Hello, world!"`

##### [Python 3](https://just.systems/man/en/settings.html#python-3)

`set shell := ["python3", "-c"]`

##### [Bash](https://just.systems/man/en/settings.html#bash)

`set shell := ["bash", "-uc"]`

##### [Z Shell](https://just.systems/man/en/settings.html#z-shell)

`set shell := ["zsh", "-uc"]`

##### [Fish](https://just.systems/man/en/settings.html#fish)

`set shell := ["fish", "-c"]`

##### [Nushell](https://just.systems/man/en/settings.html#nushell)

`set shell := ["nu", "-c"]`

If you want to change the default table mode to `light`:

`set shell := ['nu', '-m', 'light', '-c']`

_[Nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell) was written in Rust, and **has cross-platform support for Windows / macOS and Linux**._
