This project allows you to run ComfyUI workflows as a serverless API endpoint on the RunPod platform. Submit workflows via API calls and receive generated images as base64 strings or S3 URLs.

#### [](https://hub.docker.com/r/runpod/worker-comfyui#quickstart)Quickstart

1.  üê≥ Choose one of the [available Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/runpod/worker-comfyui#available-docker-images) for your serverless endpoint (e.g., `runpod/worker-comfyui:<version>-sd3`).
2.  üìÑ Follow the [Deployment Guide](https://hub.docker.com/r/runpod/worker-comfyui/docs/deployment.md) to set up your RunPod template and endpoint.
3.  ‚öôÔ∏è Optionally configure the worker (e.g., for S3 upload) using environment variables - see the full [Configuration Guide](https://hub.docker.com/r/runpod/worker-comfyui/docs/configuration.md).
4.  üß™ Pick an example workflow from [`test_resources/workflows/`](https://hub.docker.com/r/runpod/worker-comfyui/test_resources/workflows/) or [get your own](https://hub.docker.com/r/runpod/worker-comfyui#getting-the-workflow-json).
5.  üöÄ Follow the [Usage](https://hub.docker.com/r/runpod/worker-comfyui#usage) steps below to interact with your deployed endpoint.

#### [](https://hub.docker.com/r/runpod/worker-comfyui#api-specification)API Specification

The worker exposes standard RunPod serverless endpoints (`/run`, `/runsync`, `/health`). By default, images are returned as base64 strings. You can configure the worker to upload images to an S3 bucket instead by setting specific environment variables (see [Configuration Guide](https://hub.docker.com/r/runpod/worker-comfyui/docs/configuration.md)).

Use the `/runsync` endpoint for synchronous requests that wait for the job to complete and return the result directly. Use the `/run` endpoint for asynchronous requests that return immediately with a job ID; you'll need to poll the `/status` endpoint separately to get the result.

Copy

The following tables describe the fields within the `input` object:

Field Path

Type

Required

Description

`input`

Object

Yes

Top-level object containing request data.

`input.workflow`

Object

Yes

The ComfyUI workflow exported in the [required format](https://hub.docker.com/r/runpod/worker-comfyui#getting-the-workflow-json).

`input.images`

Array

No

Optional array of input images. Each image is uploaded to ComfyUI's `input` directory and can be referenced by its `name` in the workflow.

###### [](https://hub.docker.com/r/runpod/worker-comfyui#inputimages-object)`input.images` Object

Each object within the `input.images` array must contain:

Field Name

Type

Required

Description

`name`

String

Yes

Filename used to reference the image in the workflow (e.g., via a "Load Image" node). Must be unique within the array.

`image`

String

Yes

Base64 encoded string of the image. A data URI prefix (e.g., `data:image/png;base64,`) is optional and will be handled correctly.

> Note
> 
> **Size Limits:** RunPod endpoints have request size limits (e.g., 10MB for `/run`, 20MB for `/runsync`). Large base64 input images can exceed these limits. See [RunPod Docs‚Å†](https://docs.runpod.io/docs/serverless-endpoint-urls).

##### [](https://hub.docker.com/r/runpod/worker-comfyui#output)Output

> Warning
> 
> **Breaking Change in Output Format (5.0.0+)**
> 
> Versions `< 5.0.0` returned the primary image data (S3 URL or base64 string) directly within an `output.message` field. Starting with `5.0.0`, the output format has changed significantly, see below

    {
      "id": "sync-uuid-string",
      "status": "COMPLETED",
      "output": {
        "images": [
          {
            "filename": "ComfyUI_00001_.png",
            "type": "base64",
            "data": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUg..."
          }
        ]
      },
      "delayTime": 123,
      "executionTime": 4567
    }
    

Copy

Field Path

Type

Required

Description

`output`

Object

Yes

Top-level object containing the results of the job execution.

`output.images`

Array of Objects

No

Present if the workflow generated images. Contains a list of objects, each representing one output image.

`output.errors`

Array of Strings

No

Present if non-fatal errors or warnings occurred during processing (e.g., S3 upload failure, missing data).

###### [](https://hub.docker.com/r/runpod/worker-comfyui#outputimages)`output.images`

Each object in the `output.images` array has the following structure:

Field Name

Type

Description

`filename`

String

The original filename assigned by ComfyUI during generation.

`type`

String

Indicates the format of the data. Either `"base64"` or `"s3_url"` (if S3 upload is configured).

`data`

String

Contains either the base64 encoded image string or the S3 URL for the uploaded image file.

> Note
> 
> The \`output.images\` field provides a list of all generated images (excluding temporary ones).
> 
> -   If S3 upload is **not** configured (default), `type` will be `"base64"` and `data` will contain the base64 encoded image string.
> -   If S3 upload **is** configured, `type` will be `"s3_url"` and `data` will contain the S3 URL. See the [Configuration Guide](https://hub.docker.com/r/runpod/worker-comfyui/docs/configuration.md#example-s3-response) for an S3 example response.
> -   Clients interacting with the API need to handle this list-based structure under `output.images`.

#### [](https://hub.docker.com/r/runpod/worker-comfyui#usage)Usage

To interact with your deployed RunPod endpoint:

1.  **Get API Key:** Generate a key in RunPod [User Settings‚Å†](https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless/user/settings) (`API Keys` section).
2.  **Get Endpoint ID:** Find your endpoint ID on the [Serverless Endpoints‚Å†](https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless/user/endpoints) page or on the `Overview` page of your endpoint.

##### [](https://hub.docker.com/r/runpod/worker-comfyui#generate-image-sync-example)Generate Image (Sync Example)

Send a workflow to the `/runsync` endpoint (waits for completion). Replace `<api_key>` and `<endpoint_id>`. The `-d` value should contain the [JSON input described above](https://hub.docker.com/r/runpod/worker-comfyui#input).

    curl -X POST \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_key>" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"input":{"workflow":{... your workflow JSON ...}}}' \
      https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<endpoint_id>/runsync
    

Copy

You can also use the `/run` endpoint for asynchronous jobs and then poll the `/status` to see when the job is done. Or you [add a `webhook` into your request‚Å†](https://docs.runpod.io/serverless/endpoints/send-requests#webhook-notifications) to be notified when the job is done.

Refer to [`test_input.json`](https://hub.docker.com/r/runpod/worker-comfyui/test_input.json) for a complete input example.

#### [](https://hub.docker.com/r/runpod/worker-comfyui#getting-the-workflow-json)Getting the Workflow JSON

To get the correct `workflow` JSON for the API:

1.  Open ComfyUI in your browser.
2.  In the top navigation, select `Workflow > Export (API)`
3.  A `workflow.json` file will be downloaded. Use the content of this file as the value for the `input.workflow` field in your API requests.
