# Performance & Stress Test Analysis

## Executive Summary

The updated `test_load_balancing.py` script successfully resolved the client-side S3 connection bottleneck, allowing for a true stress test of the RunPod serverless endpoint. The test, involving 30 requests with a maximum concurrency of 15, demonstrates that the system scales as expected by provisioning multiple workers.

However, the high initial burst of traffic revealed a new bottleneck: **worker provisioning and cold-start latency**. While the majority of requests were successful, a portion failed due to the RunPod load balancer's 2-minute request timeout, as the demand for workers temporarily outpaced the supply.

## Test Configuration

-   **Test Script**: `test_load_balancing.py`
-   **Total Requests**: 30
-   **Maximum Concurrency**: 15 simultaneous tasks

## Analysis of Results

### Positive Findings

1.  **Client-Side Bottleneck Resolved**: The logs show no `Connection pool is full` errors. The combination of an increased `boto3` connection pool and the `asyncio.Semaphore` effectively managed the client-side load.
2.  **Successful Scaling**: The system successfully processed 26 out of 30 requests (an 86.7% success rate), with multiple requests being handled in parallel. The logs show a steady flow of new requests starting as old ones complete, confirming the semaphore is managing concurrency correctly.
3.  **Stable Performance Under Sustained Load**: After the initial burst and timeouts, the system stabilized and successfully processed all subsequent requests, indicating that once enough workers were warm, the endpoint could handle the sustained throughput.

### Identified Bottleneck: Worker Cold-Start Latency

The primary issue identified is the time it takes for new serverless workers to be provisioned, download the image, initialize the environment, and load the model into VRAM.

-   **Failures**: At `20:56:26`, four requests (`req-14`, `req-8`, `req-5`, `req-7`) failed with a `400 Bad Request`.
-   **Root Cause**: These requests were part of the initial batch sent around `20:54:25`. They failed almost exactly 2 minutes later. This corresponds directly to the RunPod load balancer's documented behavior: if a request cannot be assigned to a healthy worker within 2 minutes, it is rejected.
-   **Conclusion**: The initial burst of 15 concurrent requests exceeded the number of immediately available workers. The load balancer queued these requests, but the time required to provision enough new workers was greater than the 2-minute timeout for some of them.

## Key Metrics

-   **Success Rate**: 86.7% (26/30)
-   **Failure Rate**: 13.3% (4/30)
-   **Reason for Failure**: RunPod load balancer request timeout (2 minutes).
-   **Average Request Time (Successful Requests)**: The processing time for successful requests varied significantly, which is characteristic of a serverless environment with cold starts.
    -   **"Warm" Worker Response**: ~25-35 seconds (e.g., `req-15`, `req-30`).
    -   **"Cold" Worker Response / Queued Request**: 40 seconds to over 1.5 minutes (e.g., `req-1`), depending on queue time.

## Recommendations

1.  **Increase Minimum Workers for High-Burst Scenarios**: To mitigate the timeout issue, the most effective solution is to configure the RunPod endpoint with a **Minimum Worker count greater than 0** (e.g., 2-3). This keeps a pool of workers constantly warm and ready to accept requests, drastically reducing the cold-start penalty at the cost of higher idle compute charges.

2.  **Implement Client-Side Retries**: The application sending requests to this endpoint should implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff. Since a `400 Bad Request` indicates a temporary capacity issue, retrying the request after a short delay is likely to succeed once a worker becomes available.

3.  **No Further Test Script Changes Needed**: The `test_load_balancing.py` script is now functioning correctly as a stress-testing tool. It accurately simulates high-concurrency scenarios, and the bottleneck it revealed is now representative of the service's architecture, not the client's limitations.
